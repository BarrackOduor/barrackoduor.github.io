    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Eng. Barrack Oduor, a registered Mechanical Engineer with the Engineers Board of Kenya (EBK), driven by a deep passion for Industrial Automation, Robotics, and Process Optimization. I find joy in integrating mechanical systems with modern control technologies to make industries more efficient, reliable, and sustainable.

My journey into engineering began from humble beginnings in Usenge, a small town that taught me the value of hard work and resilience. After performing highly in Usenge Primary School, I earned a life-changing opportunity through the Wings to Fly scholarship program by Equity Bank. That support opened the door to Ramba High School, where I continued to pursue excellence and curiosity for how machines work. I sat for my KCSE in 2017, determined to turn my dreams into reality.

That determination led me to Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST), where I studied Mechanical Engineering. Those years were filled with learning, creativity, and endless hours in labs and workshops. On December 11, 2024, I proudly graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering (Second Class Upper Division),a milestone that marked the beginning of my professional journey.

My career started at Mabati Rolling Mills, where I worked as a Mechanical Maintenance Intern. It was there that I first understood how theory meets real industrial systems, keeping machines running, improving efficiency, and learning the rhythm of production lines. Later, I joined the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute (KIRDI) as a Graduate Mechanical Attachee, where I experienced the innovation side of engineering  turning ideas into practical industrial solutions.

Afterward, I joined Robotech Africa Limited as a Machine Specialist, where my true passion for industrial automation and robotics came alive. I worked on machine integration, control systems, and process optimization, and began to see the incredible potential of merging mechanical systems with digital intelligence.

Today, I’m committed to advancing automation solutions that drive sustainable industrial growth, not just in Kenya but across the world. My goal is to help industries embrace smart technologies, improve productivity, and inspire the next generation of engineers who believe in innovation with purpose.

Every system I design, every process I improve, and every project I take on is guided by one mission to make industries smarter, greener, and more efficient for a better tomorrow.</p>
